     * 3169. Count Days Without Meetings
     * You are given a positive integer days representing the total number of days an employee is available for work (starting from day 1). You are also given a 2D array meetings of size n where, meetings[i] = [start_i, end_i] represents the starting and ending days of meeting i (inclusive).
     *
     * Return the count of days when the employee is available for work but no meetings are scheduled.
     *
     * Note: The meetings may overlap.
     *
     *
     *
     * Example 1:
     *
     * Input: days = 10, meetings = [[5,7],[1,3],[9,10]]
     *
     * Output: 2
     *
     * Explanation:
     *
     * There is no meeting scheduled on the 4th and 8th days.
     *
     * Example 2:
     *
     * Input: days = 5, meetings = [[2,4],[1,3]]
     *
     * Output: 1
     *
     * Explanation:
     *
     * There is no meeting scheduled on the 5th day.
     *
     * Example 3:
     *
     * Input: days = 6, meetings = [[1,6]]
     *
     * Output: 0
     *
     * Explanation:
     *
     * Meetings are scheduled for all working days.
     *
     *
     *
     * Constraints:
     *
     * 1 <= days <= 109
     * 1 <= meetings.length <= 105
     * meetings[i].length == 2
     * 1 <= meetings[i][0] <= meetings[i][1] <= days
