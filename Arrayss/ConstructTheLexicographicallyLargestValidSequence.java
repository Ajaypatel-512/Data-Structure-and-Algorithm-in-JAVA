     * 1718. Construct the Lexicographically Largest Valid Sequence
     * Given an integer n, find a sequence that satisfies all of the following:
     *
     * The integer 1 occurs once in the sequence.
     * Each integer between 2 and n occurs twice in the sequence.
     * For every integer i between 2 and n, the distance between the two occurrences of i is exactly i.
     * The distance between two numbers on the sequence, a[i] and a[j], is the absolute difference of their indices, |j - i|.
     *
     * Return the lexicographically largest sequence. It is guaranteed that under the given constraints, there is always a solution.
     *
     * A sequence a is lexicographically larger than a sequence b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ, sequence a has a number greater than the corresponding number in b. For example, [0,1,9,0] is lexicographically larger than [0,1,5,6] because the first position they differ is at the third number, and 9 is greater than 5.
     *
     *
     *
     * Example 1:
     *
     * Input: n = 3
     * Output: [3,1,2,3,2]
     * Explanation: [2,3,2,1,3] is also a valid sequence, but [3,1,2,3,2] is the lexicographically largest valid sequence.
     * Example 2:
     *
     * Input: n = 5
     * Output: [5,3,1,4,3,5,2,4,2]
     *
     *
     * Constraints:
     *
     * 1 <= n <= 20
